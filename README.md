# Dark Heresy 2E - Continued

An **UNOFFICIAL** system for playing Dark Heresy 2E on [Foundry VTT](https://foundryvtt.com/).

Originally created by Necaladun, this fork lives under the USBinquisition banner and updates the system for Foundry V13's jQuery changes. It's vibe-coded and checked over with his limited skills.

It provides support for **character sheets only**, game content should be drawn from official source books.

The project is being continued under the GPL-3.0 License after the original author deleted their project.
